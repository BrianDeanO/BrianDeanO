### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Dean, and I am currently working towards earning a bachelor's degree in computer science at Washington State University Tri-Cities. 

Before transferring to WSU Tri-Cities, I attended Columbia Basin College, where I earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Science.

In the fall of 2022, I will be transferring to the Washington State University Tri-Cities computer science degree program.

While attending WSU Tri-Cities, I am a part-time intern in a software development team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

Within this internship, I consistently work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.

While I am gaining much experience in languages dedicated to web development, my two best languages to code in are C++ and Java.

I also have experience with creating and working with relational database systems through SQL.

And to expand upon my programming language portfolio, I am currently teaching myself Python. 

I have strong interests in data analytics and visual computing.
