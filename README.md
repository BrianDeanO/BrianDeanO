### Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Dean, and I am currently working towards earning a bachelor's degree in computer science at Washington State University Tri-Cities. 

Before transferring to WSU Tri-Cities, I attended Columbia Basin College, where I earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Science.

While attending WSU Tri-Cities, I am also a part-time intern working in a software development team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

Within this internship, I consistently work with JavaScript, React, and HTML/CSS.

While I am gaining much experience in languages dedicated to web development, my two best languages to code in are C++.

I also have experience programming in Java and using JavaFX, and with creating and working with relational database systems through SQL.

To expand upon my programming language portfolio, I am currently teaching myself Python. 

I have strong interests in web-application development and UIX design.
