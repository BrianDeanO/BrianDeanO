### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Dean, and I am a full-time student at Columbia Basin College currently working towards earning an Associate's Degree. 

In the fall of 2022, I will be transferring to the Washington State University Tri-Cities computer science degree program.

My two best languages to code in are C++ and Java.

I have experience with creating and working with relational database systems through SQL.

And to expand upon my programming language portfolio, I am currently teaching myself Python. 

I have strong interests in data analytics and visual computing.
